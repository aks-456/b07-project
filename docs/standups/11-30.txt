Name: Akshath

What have you done since yesterday?
- Instead of focusing on user story 2, I switched towards working on allowing admins to edit course information (user story 6).
- I was able to allow users to edit the course, but it creates duplicates so I still have to work on that.

- Fixing duplicate courses issue from user story 6, as well as start working on users story 3, to allow users to generate a timeline. 

Any impediments or stumbling blocks?
- None
