Name: Akshath

What have you done since yesterday?
- Added an option for a dropdown for admins to read all the courses added by the admin in the realtime db, and select prerequisite courses when adding a new course
- Changed how I store data. Instead of storing courses under the id of the admin user, I disregarded the user who created the courses and stored them all together

What are you planning on doing today?
- Work on user story 2 to allow the user to add courses they've already taken
- I plan on initiating our second sprint, where we work on the remaining user stories (mainly 2, 4, 6) as well as any remaining tasks that are incomplete from the first sprint

Any impediments or stumbling blocks?
    - None so far
